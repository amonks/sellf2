# Your Google Data

Google's products are used by billions of people.

In September 2009, Google announced the foundation of a new engineering team called the [Data Liberation Front](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Data_Liberation_Front). In 2011, they released [Google Takeout](https://www.google.com/settings/takeout), a single page from which you can export some of the data Google has collected about you.

## Download

You can use [Google Takeout](https://www.google.com/settings/takeout) to download an archive of your Google data.

When you visit the page, you'll see a list of Google products, with controls to include or exclude them from your archive. Click *Next* at the bottom of the page.

On the next page, you can choose the download format of your archive, and start the export process. Some time later, you'll receive an email from Google with a download link.
