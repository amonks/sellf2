# Pricing your data

On sellf.org, you can set your own prices for your data.

Before selling anything personal, it's important to think through the following questions:

*   What am I getting paid for?
*   What will happen if I sell this?
*   What could someone learn about me from this data?
*   What could they learn about other people?
*   What is my privacy worth?

For communication-related data, remember that a conversation has two sides. You aren't just selling things *you* said, but also what your friend said.

## Sellf.org fee

Remember that on each purchase, sellf.org will deduct a <%= fee_percentage %>% fee from the price you set here.
