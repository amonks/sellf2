# sellf.org Intro

`sellf.org` is a company that explores the ramifications of the commodification of personal data, by operating a free for-sale-by-owner data market. The premise: "Who's better equipped to sell your data than you are?"

By revealing the market value of consumer data, `sellf.org` creates and investigates a world where consumerism can be self supporting. Can you make a living by publishing how you spend that living?

More importantly, `sellf.org` seeks to attack the current form of the relationship between Big Data Collection and the public.

By engaging the public through a commerical, rather than an art context, the company seeks to surface the conversation about personal commoditization.

It forces people to consider questions personally that an art-framed piece couldn't ('what am I getting paid for?' 'What will happen if I sell this?' 'How much will I sell my data for?' 'What is my privacy worth?') by making the public examine the potential repercussions of a conscious contract rather than a passive one.
