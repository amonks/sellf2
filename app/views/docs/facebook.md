# Your Facebook Data

Facebook is one of the largest players right now in the personal data collection business. If you're a Facebook user, and especially if you've been using the service for a long time, they likely have tons of information about you.

In October 2010, Facebook started allowing users to download an archive of some of the data Facebook has on them.

## Request and download

![Facebook Settings ](docs/facebook_settings.png)

On your Facebook [settings page](https://www.facebook.com/settings), you'll find a link to 'Download a copy of your Facebook data'.

On the following page, you'll be prompted to re-enter your password. Facebook will send you an email shortly to confirm your request.

Some time later, usually about 15 minutes, you'll receive another email from an `@facebookmail.com` address, with a temporary secret link at which you can download your data.

## What you get

![Facebook Downloaded Zip ](docs/facebook_zip.png)

The zipped download will contain a collection of html files with all of your textual Facebook data, plus folders with your photos and videos. For me, `messages.htm` was the largest file by far.

Go through the downloaded data and make sure you're comfortable selling the information within publicly.

Some users choose to sell only some of these `.htm` files. Some choose to sell the whole `.zip`. Some do both at different prices. How you choose to monetize your Facebook data is up to you, and a decision which should not be taken lightly.
