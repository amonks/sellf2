# Data To Sell

Data is a pretty broad term. The most obvious example of data is the information that websites you use collect about you. But anything can be data.

## Data Collected By Websites

Currently, companies like Facebook and Google are gathering information about you and monetizing that information. Many of these companies allow you to export some of your that information.

## Collecting Your Own

You can also collect and sell any other type of data. We think data brokers as selling to advertisers, but other people buy data all the time. You might buy kindle books. Or music from iTunes. Here are some ideas:

*   Pictures of what you consume, eat, or purchase
*   Audio recordinds of events in your life
*   Writing you haven't published
